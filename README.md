# homework-wk01

Homework assignment for week 1 of DU's bootcamp program.

Was given the following criteria of changes to make to both HTML and CSS files.

(GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title)

Also practice on how to create a repo, and commit changes with comments to Github.
